The focus of this blog is to provide step-by-step documentation of my self-study, practice, learning, and general experiences as I work on pursuing a career in cybersecurity. For some background, I have no traditional experience in cybersecurity or IT, but became interested in the field while working as an Army SIGINT officer. That exposure really hooked me on finding a way to work in the industry, and I started small with a few CompTIA certs to see if I was truly willing to stick with the amount of effort such a career transition would require. After A+, Network+, Security+, and CySA+, I could definitively say I was even more excited than my initial interest; I feel like each step snowballed and encouraged me to want to learn more and more... and more. I followed those certs up with the CCNA, which I found really fun and significantly more valuable as far as actually becoming familiar with networking than any of the CompTIA certs. Next, I jumped into SANS SEC504 and GIAC GCIH, which was great (shoutout to Joshua Wright for the awesome work he did with designing the course!). GCIH, which had at least one module per section highlighting cloud attacks and how to mitigate them, sparked some interest in cloud security. I'm still trying to work out if I can learn enough over the next year and a half to find a place in cloudsec straight out of the Army.

The above essentially amounts to what I felt was a decent baseline and took roughly a year. Moving forward, I am planning on getting far more hands-on (hopefully spending a lot less time on certs that sometimes feel like nothing more than vocab test) in favor of homelabbing, coding, and breaking stuff.

I am hoping this blog is helpful to anyone else coming from a similar position, especially transitioning servicemembers. Everything done here (from homelab-type stuff to my Python code) will almost definetely have been done better by someone else. However, the purpose is to learn, experiment, and improve, rather than create anything novel.
