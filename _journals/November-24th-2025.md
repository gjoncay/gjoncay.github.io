After passing the AWS Solutions Architect Associate exam, I am absolutely done with multiple choice tests for a good bit. I've been digging through as many resources as possible over the last week to lay out a study plan tailored to building threat intel skills and knowledge. If you are trying to follow a similar path, I hope this journal is helpful. I'm going to focus my effort into a few areas, and have built this list of resources to support my study:
