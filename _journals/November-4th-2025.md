Well, here we go. It seems like I've worked out most of the kinks as far as setting up this blog on both the GitHub and Jekyll side. For a new Linux user, it was kind of a pain. I had to bounce around the theme file I cloned and determine what actually should be edited... and what should not. In other words, I learned my lesson regarding _site being wiped and recreated.

Now may be a good time to lay out some goals for the blog in general:
- Set up a mini-environment complete with several VMs running:
  - SIEM (likely Wazuh)
  - Network monitoring (Zeek)
  - Attacker box (probably Kali)
  - vulnerable user endpoint
  - vulnerable web server 
  - etc.
- Work in as much Python as I can to the homelab. Getting coding skills to be second nature is just going to be reps on reps on reps. I'd like to keep my practice defender-focused, especially because I do not think I can stand making another simplistic game or tkinter UI.
- Integrate the cloud along the way. I'd like to find a good way to work in AWS free tier resources or get them talking to the local VMs if I can.
- Threat Intel! This is what I can nerd out about for sure. As an intelligence professional Army-side, I'd like to get into enriching data, pulling data from CTI APIs, and getting familiar with some open source tools.

Cool. Hopefully in a ~year this looks like something that vaguely accompolished those goals!
