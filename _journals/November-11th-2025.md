Planning on continuing to refine goals and plan for the lab. Once I get comfortable with Wazuh, I'd like to segment the network to better emulate a live environment. I'll likely set up management, DMZ, and production networks with a VM acting as a firewall/router between them.

Next step will also likely be to install the Damn Vulnerable Web App on one of the Ubuntu servers as well as setting up a Kali machine to simulate attacks.
